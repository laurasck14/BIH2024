# Data Integration in GenDaB
Internship at the Berlin Institute of Health (BIH) as part of the Msc Bioinformatics (University of Potsdam). The code found here is mostly from API extractions of data in order to be able to upload the corresponding datasets into the GenDaB database.

**EnsemblAPI**\
Used the Ensembl API to obtain the Ensembl protein IDs from the proteins in the BioGRID database that were not present in the STRING database. It was also used to update some old gene symbols used in BioGRID.
